MY I3E assignment is a first-person puzzle adventure game made in Unity. The player takes on the role of a character trapped in a hazardous testing facility. The main objective is to collect four pieces of a broken keycard, which are hidden throughout the level. Once all four pieces have been collected, the player must use them to unlock a final door, leading outside to freedom and a victory screen triggered by collecting their medicine.

The game introduces several environmental hazards. Lava drops that are darker coloured on platforms and deal 10 damage upon contact. In contrast, there are also lava pools which deal 100 damage—effectively killing the player instantly if they fall into one. The player must stay alert and avoid these dangers while searching for the keycard fragments.

After successfully collecting all the keycard pieces, the player is led into a room filled with boxes of various sizes. This area contains a physics-based puzzle where the player must build a staircase by pushing and stacking the boxes. By creating a makeshift staircase, the player gains access to a ledge that leads to the final door. Once this door is opened using the collected keycard pieces, the player enters an outdoor area where they can collect the medicine, triggering the win condition.

Controls: The player uses the keyboard and mouse to navigate the world. Controls are as follows: W, A, S, D – Move the player Mouse Movement – Look around Spacebar – Jump Shift - Run Push Boxes – Simply walk into them to push

Puzzle Overview: To solve the game and escape successfully, the player must complete the following sequence: Explore the environment and find all 4 keycard pieces, each needing to complete an obstacle course.

Avoid hazards: Lava drops fall periodically and deal 10 damage. Lava pools are lethal and deal 100 damage (instant death).

Box stacking puzzle: In the room after collecting all keycards, push boxes to form stairs. Place smaller boxes in front of larger ones to make an incline. Carefully climb the makeshift structure to reach the door.

Once the player has passed through the final door, they will reach an open outdoor area. The medicine object is located here, and touching it will trigger the win screen and end the game.

Platform and System Requirements: This game is designed to run on Windows, Mac, or WebGL platforms via Unity. It was developed using Unity 2022.3 LTS and works best with the following setup: A mid-range PC or laptop with 4GB RAM or more A mouse and keyboard for input Recommended screen resolution: 1920x1080 No special graphics card is required, but integrated graphics support is recommended for smooth performance

Known Issues and Limitations: While the game is fully playable, there are a few known bugs and limitations: Audio may not play fully if the player collects the medicine right after entering the outdoor area. No save system has been implemented. If the player dies, they must restart the level.
